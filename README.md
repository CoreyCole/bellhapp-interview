The purpose of this interview question is to display the menu. The files of interest are:
  - The `Menu` provider (`src/providers/menu.ts`)
  - The HomePage (`src/pages/home.ts`)
  
The task is to display all the items on the menu in any way that you see fit using angular. We'd like you to display all the items with their `name` `price` and the names of all the `options` the item has, if any. This list of items should be grouped my MenuName and SectionName, e.g. all of the items in "Lunch" > "Lunch Deals!" should be displayed together and display the name of the menu and section above the group of items.
